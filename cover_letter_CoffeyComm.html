            Dear Hiring Manager,
        </p>
        <p>
            Having met some of the people that work for Coffey Communications when they volunteer to serve dinner at
            the Christian Aid Center, I knew it was a place I would like to work some day.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have extensive experience working with some very diverse and sometimes challenging people.
            I have had the opportunity to work in customer service, with homeless people and recovering veterans.
            I feel this varied experience will bring a unique perspective when working with both clients and co-workers
            while at Coffey Communications.
            In addition, my experience working on many of my own open source projects and those of others has also given
            me a broad background that I think will be very useful to your company.
            For instance, one of my projects was the Innovation Award Winner for October 2016 on the
            <a href="https://www.phpclasses.org/browse/author/944277.html">PHPClasses</a> website.
            While working with electronics in the military, I developed excellent troubleshooting and attention to
            details skills.
            Since then, I have been able to apply these skills when I write new software and solve problems with
            existing code bases.
        </p>
        <p>
            I believe my set of inter-personal, programming experience, and teamwork approach to software make me
            uniquely qualified for a position on your team. I look forward to speaking with you. You can reach me at
            509-593-9743
            or dragonrun1@gmail.com.
            Thank you for your time and consideration.
        </p>
